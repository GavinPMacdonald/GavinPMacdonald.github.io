					<p>My name is <strong>Gavin Macdonald</strong>, I am a junior at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville studying Computer Management Information Systems. I built this website to allow any potential employers or clients to find out more about me. I have been building websites for a couple months now, but all of it has been self-taught. I use the power of the internet to increase my learning capabilities and become the person I want to be.<p> 
					<p>Currently, I am a local restaurant manager, I've developed new closing systems for multiple companies and worked as the family IT guy. I love to read non-fiction books, going on runs, and increasing my skills as a developer. This is my personal website; it acts as aggregator for all my personal web design work.<p> 
					<p>If you would like to hire me, or get into contact with me, I have my email above.</p>

I also was the first person most members came to when encountering a problem at Sam's Club. This meant that I was the one to help resolve the problem, and make sure the member was happy when leaving. I was also a part of creating a closing cashier checklist for all other cashiers to follow after we close. I worked closely with my team leader and the store manager to create this checklist.</more></p>

					</p>
					<p><more>While being the club treasurer for the E-Sports Club, I developed and implemented a cash management system. This implementation allowed for the other club officers to know the club balance without having to manually figure it out, which saves time. The system included a way for officers to enter and remove withstanding transactions to accurately see how much money our club had at any given time. I was also the leader for identifying and developing strategies for increasing income and club spending. The implementation has allowed our club to increase our funds, as well as spend our money in ways to increase our overall membership.</more></p>
